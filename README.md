## Ask Phase
### Business Task
Analyze smart device usage data to identify trends in how consumers are using non-Bellabeat products and provide insights into Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

Questions to answer for stakeholders:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Prepare Phase
### Dataset Source & Information
[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits

### Dataset Credibility and Observations
Data was stored, identified organization, data format, and then sorted and filtered using Google Sheets. Limited dataset includes 18 CSV files. Each file contains different quantitative data from 30 users. It is a small sample and there was no demographic information provided, so we could be facing a sampling bias. Therefore, the sample might not be representative of the population as a whole. Also, dataset is not current and there are only 2 months of data available.

## Process Phase
I will be uploading the CSV files that are useful in BigQuery and using cleaning techniques in SQL due to the size of the data. I will be focusing in the folloging datasets:
